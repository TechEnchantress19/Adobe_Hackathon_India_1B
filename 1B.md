# Persona-Driven PDF Analysis System

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that performs intelligent PDF analysis using persona-driven content extraction and ranking. The system allows users to upload multiple PDFs and specify their persona (role) and job-to-be-done, then extracts and ranks relevant content sections tailored to that specific context. The application uses machine learning models for semantic similarity analysis and provides adaptive headings that change based on the user's persona.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Flask architecture with distinct core processing modules:

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Web Application**: Main web server handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Core Processing Pipeline**: Modular system with specialized processors for different aspects of PDF analysis
- **CLI Mode Support**: Alternative command-line interface for batch processing
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration system

### Frontend Architecture
- **Bootstrap-based UI**: Responsive web interface with modern styling
- **JavaScript Enhancement**: Client-side form validation, progress tracking, and results display
- **AJAX Communication**: Asynchronous communication with backend for file uploads and processing

## Key Components

### Core Processing Modules

1. **PDF Processor** (`core/pdf_processor.py`)
   - Extracts text, headings, tables, and document structure
   - Uses PyMuPDF and pdfplumber for comprehensive content extraction
   - Supports camelot for advanced table detection
   - Handles multilingual content and various PDF formats

2. **Persona Analyzer** (`core/persona_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes user-provided persona and job descriptions
   - Uses SentenceTransformer models for semantic understanding
   - Maintains persona-specific keyword dictionaries
   - Generates context for content ranking

3. **Ranking Engine** (`core/ranking_engine.py`)
   - Multi-factor scoring algorithm combining semantic similarity, keyword matching, and positional weighting
   - Uses machine learning models for content relevance scoring
   - Implements configurable ranking weights for different factors

4. **Output Generator** (`core/output_generator.py`)
   - Creates structured JSON output with persona-adaptive headings
   - Generates metadata, extracted sections, and subsection analysis
   - Tailors content presentation to specific persona contexts

### Utility Modules

1. **Table Extractor** (`utils/table_extractor.py`)
   - Advanced table processing and analysis
   - Handles various table formats and structures
   - Provides data quality assessment

2. **Text Processor** (`utils/text_processor.py`)
   - Text cleaning and normalization utilities
   - Handles PDF extraction artifacts
   - Provides content quality analysis

## Data Flow

1. **Input Phase**: User uploads PDFs and specifies persona/job through web interface
2. **Processing Phase**: 
   - PDFs are processed to extract text, headings, and tables
   - Content is analyzed in context of user's persona
   - Sections are ranked by relevance using multi-factor algorithm
3. **Output Phase**: Results are formatted with persona-adaptive headings and returned as JSON

## External Dependencies

### Machine Learning
- **SentenceTransformers**: Used for semantic similarity analysis (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)
- **scikit-learn**: Provides cosine similarity calculations
- **numpy**: Numerical computations for scoring algorithms

### PDF Processing
- **PyMuPDF**: Primary PDF text and structure extraction
- **pdfplumber**: Enhanced text and table extraction
- **camelot**: Advanced table detection and extraction

### Web Framework
- **Flask**: Core web application framework
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend CSS framework
- **Chart.js**: Results visualization

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Flask development server with debug mode
- Local file storage in temporary directories
- Environment variables for configuration

### Production Considerations
- Configurable upload directories and file size limits
- Model caching for improved performance
- Processing timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- Support for containerized deployment

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration system
- Separate settings for different deployment environments
- Configurable processing parameters and model settings
- Support for both CLI and web deployment modes

## Recent Changes

### July 28, 2025
- **Enhanced Offline Capabilities**: Created comprehensive CLI mode (`cli_offline.py`) that works without dependencies
- **Docker Support**: Added Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment  
- **Multi-Platform Scripts**: Created run_cli.sh (Linux/Mac) and run_cli.bat (Windows) for easy execution
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed CLI usage guide with examples and troubleshooting
- **Demo Mode Integration**: Both web and CLI modes now work in demo mode when dependencies are unavailable
- **Fixed Package Installation Issues**: Resolved disk space constraints by creating lightweight demo versions

The application is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between different processing stages and support for both interactive web usage and batch processing scenarios. Now includes robust offline functionality and Docker deployment options.
